 Information:
</h2>
 
<p>
 System Call Interception is a technique used to monitor, analyze, and make calls to an ( OS ) - operating system. A type of call called a system calls requests from one program to the operating system and asks it to do tasks such as hardware communication, file management, and memory allocation. Then, by intercepting these types of calls, security tools can review and check them before enrolling actions to modify and block any bad request to protect the main system. 

</p>
 
<h3>
 Key Ideas:
</h3>
 
<p>
 There are several different types of system calls that come into play. They are categorized into 5 main types such as process control , " File manipulation ", " Device manipulation', 'information maintenance ' and  ' communication. Process control lets a program take charge of running other programs on the system. File manipulation is 'reading and writing to files'
</p>
 

<p>
Device manipulation is asking for specific device requests from the OS. System call interception can make computers much safer by being able to guard and watch what running programs do while communicating with the operating system. This can help filter out the bad requests and let the security tools spot any threats before they develop into a bigger issue. It is a good way to protect computers from any type of future harm.
</p>
 
<h3>
 Conclusion:
</h3>
 
<p>
 System call interception is a way to monitor or change how programs interact with the operating system. It's useful for debugging, improving security, and making the system act like another. Computers and software keep on changing with the years and better ways to intercept system calls. The goal in the end is to make it work much better and more precise without slowing things down.
