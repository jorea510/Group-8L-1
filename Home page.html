            <h2>About Interception</h2>
            <p>Interception in computer science refers to capturing or monitoring data as it goes through a system or network of some sort. It is also commonly used in cybersecurity for intrusion detection but can also be exploited by hackers for malicious purposes. Some other ethical applications include network monitoring, intrusion detection, and debugging. Attackers usually use interception for things like spying, keylogging, or data theft. Interception is important to make cybersecurity stronger with its defenses and helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information. There are three types of interception and the first one I’m going to discuss is network interception. This is where data packets traveling over a network are monitored or modified. Some tools exist that allow security professionals to analyze network traffic and detect potential threats. Firewalls and proxy servers also use interception to filter and protect any confidential data from any cyber threats. Another type is system call interception, which involves monitoring or altering operating system-level processes. This is most used for debugging and security applications. The last type of interception is function interception, and it’s when software alters how applications behave by hooking into their functions. Interception is widely used in cybersecurity for hacking and malware analysis. Hackers will use network sniffers to identify vulnerabilities, while also security analysts rely on system call monitoring to detect unauthorized access attempts. They can also raise privacy and security concerns. So, people would avoid this by using encryption or an endpoint protection software to prevent unauthorized data interception. In the end, interception plays a big part in both cybersecurity and cyber threats. Interception can be a valuable tool and be used for good, but can also be used by people who don’t want to do good things with it, like compromising systems.

Data communication helps make sure that applications can be used for complex network operations instead of just basic things. Cloud computing uses remote servers to transfer resources such as storage and applications. It transfers over the interned instead of being kept on a physical device. Cloud computing and data communication helps businesses and individuals better manage applications, data and other resources.

They provide a set of rules and tools for one system to request data or services from another without having to understand the inner workings of that system. APIs are made up of endpoints (URLs where requests are made), methods (actions that can be taken), and protocols (communication rules).

A type of call called a system calls requests from one program to the operating system and asks it to do tasks such as hardware communication, file management, and memory allocation. Then, by intercepting these calls, security tools can review and check them before enrolling actions to modify and block any bad request to protect the main system.
