            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Summary</h2> The first article, 'Review of Machine Learning Techniques for Network Traffic Classification' by Niharika Sharmaa and Bhavna Arora reviews how computers use machine learning to analyze and classify internet traffic. This can help to distinguish between normal data like messages and videos, and potentially harmful activity. The article goes deeper into the different machine learning techniques which ask a series of like yes or no questions to sort traffic and neural networks. This can mimic the way a human brain learns patterns and support vector machines which are abbreviated as SVM. This helps separate different types of network traffic by studying patterns in data speed, source, and behavior. These smart systems can detect threats and improve network security so it can ensure that the internet runs smoothly and safely.

<section> The second article 'Guide to a Secure Enterprise Network Landscape' by Ramaswamy Chandramouli explains how businesses can keep their computer networks safe from any hacker and or cyber threat. The article also talks about the different ways companies or businesses can protect their data by using strong passwords, firewalls, and encryption. And by practicing these it can help keep you or anything safe. The article brings up the crucial points of updating software, checking for suspicious activity, and teaching employees how to stay safe online. Since cyber threats keep changing and businesses are needing to constantly improve their security to protect important information from being stolen or misused. The article suggests using a layered defense strategy that basically means to have multiple security tools working together, just like having locks, alarms, and cameras to protect a house.

<section>The third and final article 'To Intercept or Not to Intercept: Analyzing TLS Interception in Network Appliances' talks about how some security tools “listen in” on encrypted internet traffic to check for dangers like viruses or hackers. This process is called TLS interception, and it’s meant to keep the networks safe, but can also cause problems. The authors found out that many of the tools aren’t built correctly, making the internet less secure by weakening encryption or not checking certificates correctly. This entirely means that hackers could and can sneak in and spy on people’s online activities. While TLS interception can help stop bad stuff online. It also must be done carefully and correctly to avoid making security even worse. The article suggests using better security rules and stronger encryption to keep both safety and privacy protected.
