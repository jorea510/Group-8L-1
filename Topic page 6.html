<body style="color:black;">Middleware is a tool that makes the exchange of data and request be smooth for systems and services, making system communication easier. It makes it easier for people who request lots of things that can involve several servers it distributes it smoothly. In other words, they facilitate communication between applications and services. For example, it can do authentication process, it makes it simpler for information to be accessed for systems in a network.</body>

<body style="color:black;">Software interception is when middleware intercepts data or request that are used for an application that is specific. It also helps middleware to perform tasks that would not be able to be done/ handled by individual applications between different systems. Some examples are debugging data, testing, and security.  The difference is that software interception is more to monitor the software components while Middleware makes it easier for interactions between software components.

Middleware started in the nineties, and it solves problems like making the process of communication simpler across different formats. It also, manages transactions that were distributed, and has helped the simplification of services. There are different types of middleware like remote procedure call (RPC) which is a program that ask for a service from a different program that is from another network. Also, the messaging type, which is making it easier for services/apps to communicate with each other and last there is Transaction(al), which uses a process that monitors transactions so it could be smooth.</body>
